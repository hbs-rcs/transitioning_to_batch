# Take baby steps: Run Your Script Code from the Terminal

**Objectives**
* Learn how to run your code from the terminal, both interactively & in batch
* Learn the scheduler job info command 'bjobs' & its options

In this section, we're going to assume
It is important for you to be able to learn some basics of using the terminal, as one 
can run batch jobs most effectively & flexibly from the terminal.

### Run Interactively from the Terminal

When starting out using a compute cluster, or often called high-performance computing (HPC)
or high-throughput computing (HTC) systems, running applications interactively most
effectively emulates how we work on our local laptop and desktop systems. Through GUI
interfaces, we can 

LSF, our scheduler, follows most resource manager conventions

1. Open your remote desktop program (NoMachine) and connect to the HSBGrid compute cluster.

2. After the session starts, open the Gnome terminal program (Applications > System Tools > Terminal).

3. By default, most applications are not 'loaded' into our session (in the terminal). Since
Spyder is bundled with Python, we'll 'load' in Spyder through the appropriate `module load`:

```{bash}
module load python/3.8.5
```

4. With Python, Spyder, and all the data science environment tools in our $PATH, we can
now run Spyder. To run interactive sessions from a terminal, we can follow the posted 
[Interactive Job instructions](https://www.hbs.edu/research-computing-services/resources/compute-cluster/running-jobs/running-a-program-submitting-a-job.aspx), 
(Working with Custom Submission Scripts > Interactive) using the MATLAB example, to run Spyder:

```{bash}
bsub -q short_int -Is -W 60 -R "rusage[mem=4000]" -M 4000 -hl spyder
```

If successful, after a few moments Spyder should open. Much has happened here:

This is all well and good, but we've only told Spyder to open, and not necessarily to open
the code file. To do that, include the path to your code file by dragging the file icon
into the terminal window after you've typed in the spyder job submission command **but not
yet pressed Enter**. Your final result should look like:

```{bash}
bsub -q short_int -Is -W 60 -R "rusage[mem=4000]" -M 4000 -hl spyder /path/to/code/file.py
```

5. Although we've loaded the code file interactively, our goal is to run it. So let's make
those adjustments. Instead of using Spyder to view and run our code, let's simply run
it using the Python interpreter by substituting in the python command:

```{bash}
bsub -q short_int -Is -W 60 -R "rusage[mem=4000]" -M 4000 -hl python /path/to/code/file.py
```

If all goes well, you should see in your terminal window the code running, albeit slowly.
That's fine. Let's press Ctrl-C to abort the code.

### Run Your Python Code in Batch

This is actually going to be much easier than it sounds, but there are a number of 
'friction points' that will appear. Those will become apparent.

1. In your terminal session, switch to running your code in batch by switching to a batch
queue (`long` or `short`) and removing the 'interactive' flag (`Is`). The `short` queue is
most appropriate, as this code will likely take minutes to run (~8.5 min on my 2020 iMac).

```{bash}
bsub -q short -W 60 -R "rusage[mem=4000]" -M 4000 -hl python /path/to/code/file.py
```

Since we're running now in batch, our scheduler will respond with our job ID, and 
we cross our fingers that it is off an running. We have every reason to expect it to
run OK, as it ran OK when doing it interactively.

### Get the Job Info with the `bsub` Command

Well, as you may have noticed, you're not quite sure what is going on. But we do have a
few options:

* Look at the directories for any file changes
* Ask the scheduler if it's still running
* Look at the job run details

Since we know we're writing out the running sum every 10 lines, our output file should
be present and growning, which we can see:

```{bash}
ls -al data/

XXX
```

Yup, it's there. But we can't see what's going on. Let's park that for a moment.

Our next option is asking the scheduler for our job status and info, which is easy to get:

```{bash}
bjobs

XXX
```

We can get a detailed report on our job by using the `-l` (long) option:

```{bash}
bjobs -l JOBID

XXX
```

Indeed, we can see our job is running, and it's pretty active, as the IDLE_FACTOR is
greater than 0.5, indicating 50% efficiency. Aside, we can see our MAX MEM is XXX; 
and so we can downgrade our RAM ask, in order to give RAM for others who might need it.
